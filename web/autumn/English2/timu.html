            There is an old saying that husbands and wives start to look and behave like each other after a time. I don't know if this was true of my mother and father.

            Both of my parents had brown hair and brown eyes and low voices. My father, <span class="col-red">__11__</span>, was eight years older than my mother and taller and thinner. He was built as straight as an arrow. My mother was shorter and had a rounder and fuller face and she looked as soft as a pillow.

            My mother was quieter and talked less than my father did. She was also a much more patient person than my father. My father was more experienced in life. He was <span class="col-red">__12__</span> to doing everything quickly. My mother, on the other hand, worked and spoke more slowly.

            They were fond of nature and sports, such as walking, gardening and swimming. They were both <span class="col-red">__13__</span> in reading and music, but my father preferred history books, while my mother liked to read romantic novels. In music, their types were similar, and they were never proud of listening to it. Most of the time they were in agreement on bringing <span class="col-red">__14__</span> their children. They both believed in giving them love and neither one believed in punishing them physically. At times, their personalities were very much alike, but at other times, they seemed very <span class="col-red">__15__</span>. Perhaps that is why none of their children knows which parent he looks or behaves like.

            1. High in the Swiss Alps many years ago, there lived a lonely shepherd（牧羊人）boy who longed for a friend to share his evenings. One night he saw three old men, each holding a glass. The first old man said：“Drink this liquid and you shall be victorious in battle.” The second old man said：“Drink this liquid and you shall have countless riches.” The last old man said：“I offer you the happiness of music-----the horn（号角）.” The boy chose the third glass, The next day, he came upon a great horn, ten feet in length, When he put his lips to it, a beautiful melody（旋律） floated across the valley. He had found a friend. So goes the legend（传说） of the horn. First known in the ninth century, the horn was used by herdsmen to call cattle, for its deep tones echoed across the mountainsides. Even today, on a quiet summer evening, its music can be heard floating among the peaks.

            Today the official language of the United Sates and most of Canada is English. However, French almost became the official language because of a war.

            The French and Indian War was fought between 1754 and 1763. The name of this war is not accurate because the war was actually between England and France. The Indian fought on the side of the French.

            France and England were trying to gain control of North America. France held Canada, and England held part of what is now the United States. However, France tried to expand its land by moving southward into New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia. When the French built a fort on the Ohio River, the residents in Virginia sent George Washington to attack the fort in 1754. However, the French defeated Washington.

            The French, aided by Indians, outsmarted（更精明） the English and won many early battles. Later, the British began to do well against the French. In the final battle in Quebec, Canada, General Wolfe of England faced General Montcalm from France. Both general died in this battle, but the English outlasted（比……持久）the French and won the battle. Thus, most of North America today has the English culture and language.

            Taking away a city’s rubbish is a big job. Every day trucks come into a city to collect it. Most rubbish is made up of things we can’t eat or use. If we kept these things, we would soon have a mountain of rubbish.

 

            In some cities the rubbish is collected and taken outside the city to a dump. Often the city dump is placed where the ground is low or there is a big hole. The kitchen rubbish is broken into small pieces and sent into the sewage（污水，排水）system. The sewage system takes away the used water from toilets, bathtubs and other places.

         

            To keep mice and flies away, some earth is used to cover the newly dumped rubbish. Later, grass may be planted on the rubbish-filled land. Finally, a house or a school may be built there, and then you’d never know that this had once been an old rubbish dump.

         

            In other cities the rubbish is burnt in special places. The fire burns everything except the metal.Sometimes the metal can be used again in factories where things are made of metal. The food parts of rubbish are put in special piles where they slowly change into something called humus（腐殖质）, which looks like black earth. It is rich with the kinds of things that feed plants and help make them grow.

            4. Oil is so important that it is sometimes called "black gold". Almost half of our energy comes from oil. We use it to run our cars and factories and to heat our homes, offices and schools. Many everyday things are made from oil. Your shirt may have oil in the material. The soap you wash your hands with might also be made from oil. Your favorite plastic toy is made from oil. Oil is hard to find, because it is trapped deep under the earth. Once the only way people knew there was oil someplace if it leaked out of the ground. Today, however, we have many ways of finding oil. One tool measures the pull of gravity. Places where gravity is weaker are more likely to have oil. Another tool is sound waves. Sound waves travel through different kinds of rocks at different speeds. We can use them to find the rocks that have oil in them. We need a lot of oil, and we are using up the oil wells we know about. Soon we must find new ways of looking for this "black gold".

            Mr. Hill arrives at London Airport, at the end of a three-week holiday in France. Usually he wears a beard (胡子). Since it has been hot there, he has shaved his beard. But his passport photo shows him with his beard. An officer looks at the photo for a moment, and says: “Will you excuse me? Please sit down. I shan't keep you long.” With this, he walks away, shows the photo to a second officer, and says: “I know that face.” The second officer looks at the passport and asks where Mr. Hill has come from. When he hears that Mr. Hill has arrived back from Paris, the second officer smiles and says: “An Englishman with a beard stole a painting in Paris on Friday, And that man looks just the kind of man ...”

            The number of people in the U.S. who choose not to marry is growing every year. By 1996 about 25 million people over the age of 21 years were living alone. 50 years ago this number was less than 2 million. One reason for this is because people are getting married at a much later age than in the past. The average age for men is now 27 years. For women it is about 25 years. Another reason is the increase in the number of divorces.

            Living alone has become more acceptable in American society. In the past people sometimes think those who lived alone were a little strange. These days, however, several of the most popular TV shows tell the story of men and women who can't meet “the right person” and who plan to be single forever. Many such single people (especially women) feel that they are more free to pursue (追求) their careers (事业) than those who are married. In a way these people are married to their jobs.

            It has been reported that in colleges across the United States, the daytime serial drama known as the soap opera has suddenly become "in". Between the hours of 11 a.m. and 4:30 pm, college television lounges are filled with soap opera fans who can't wait to see the next episode in the lives of their favorite characters.

            Actually, soaps are more than a college favorite; they're a youth favorite. When school is out, high-school students are in front of their TV sets. One young working woman admitted that she turned down a higher paying job rather than give up watching her favorite serials. During the 1960's, it was uncommon for young people to watch soap operas. The mood of the sixties was very different from now. It was a time of seriousness, and talk was about social issues of great importance.

            Now, seriousness has been replaced by fun. Young people want to be happy. It may seem strange that they should turn to soap opera, which is known for showing trouble in people's lives. But soap opera is enjoyment. Young people can identify with the soap opera character, who, like the college-age viewer, is looking for happy love, and probably not finding it. And soap opera gives young people a chance to feel close to people without having to bear any responsibility for their problems.

            In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 pm. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it’s a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance. In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person, who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence.

            翻译：在美国，早上不习惯打电话给某人。如果你在一天早上给他打电话，当他剃须或吃早餐的时候，通话时间表明这个问题非常重要，需要立即关注。晚上11点之后的电话也是一样的意思。如果有人在睡觉时间收到电话，他就认为这是一个生死攸关的问题。为电话选择的时间表明其重要性。在社会生活中，时间起着非常重要的作用。在美国，如果邀请晚餐在派对前三或四天才能延长，客人往往觉得他们不被高度评价。但在所有国家都不是这样。在世界其他地区，由于超过一个星期之外的计划往往被遗忘，因此预先提前约定太愚蠢了。时间的意义在世界不同的地方不同。因此，来自不同文化的人们之间产生误解，处理时间不同。例如，在美国生活中，快速度高度重视。如果人员不及时，可能被视为不礼貌或不完全负责。在美国，没有人会想到一个等待一个小时的业务伙伴，这样做太不礼貌了。一个迟到5分钟的人会说几句话，尽管也许他不会完成这句话。

            The French Revolution broke out in 1789. At the time France was in a crisis. The government was badly run and people’s lives were miserable. King Louis XIV tried to control the national parliament and raise more taxes. But his effort failed. He ordered his troops to Versailles. The people thought that Louis intended to put down the Revolution by force. On July 14, 1789, they stormed and took the Bastille, where political prisoners were kept. Ever since that day, July 14 has been the French National Day. Louis tried to flee the country in 1792, to get support from Austria and Prussia. However, he was caught and put in prison. In September 1792, the monarchy was abolished. In the same year, Louis was executed. A few months later his wife, Marie, also had her head cut off. The Revolution of France had frightened the other kings of Europe. Armies from Austria and Prussia began to march against France. The French raised republican armies to defend the nation. The Revolution went through a period of terror. Thousands of people lost their lives. In the end, power passed to Napoleon Bonaparte.

            Mr. Tom Forester lived by himself a long way from town. He hardly ever left his home, but one day he went into town to buy some things in the market. After he had bought them, he went into a restaurant and sat down at a table by himself. When he looked around, he saw several old people put glasses on before reading their newspapers, so after lunch he decided to go to a shop to buy himself some glasses too. He walked along the road, and soon found a shop.

            The man in the shop made him try on a lot of glasses, but Tom always said, "No, I can't read with these."

            The man became more and more puzzled（迷惑不解）, until finally he said, "Excuse me, but can you read at all?"

            "No, of course I can't!" Tom said angrily. "If I was already able to read, do you think I would have come here to buy glasses?"

            Shyness is the cause of much unhappiness for a great many people. Shy people are anxious and self-conscious; that is, they are excessively concerned with their own appearance and actions. Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes?

            It is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must negatively affect people. A person’s conception of himself or herself is reflected in the way he or she behaves, and the way a person behaves affects other people’s reactions. In general, the way people think about themselves has a profound effect on all areas of their lives.

            Shy people, having low self-esteem, are likely to be passive and easily influenced by others. They need reassurance that they are doing “the right thing.” Shy people are very sensitive to criticism; they feel it confirms their feelings of inferiority. They also find it difficult to be pleased by compliment with a statement like this one, “You’re just saying that to make me feel good. I know it’s not true.” It is clear that while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful.

            Can shyness be completely eliminated, or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can overcome shyness with determined and patient efforts in building self-confidence. Since shyness goes hand in hand with a lack of self-esteem, it is important for people to accept their weaknesses as well as their strengths.

            Each one of us is a unique, worthwhile individual, interested in our own personal ways. The better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to live up to our full potential. Let’s not allow shyness to block our chances for a rich and fulfilling life.

            翻译：害羞是很多人不快乐的原因。害羞的人急于自我意识;那就是他们过分关心自己的外表和行为。思想中不断发生的思想：我在做什么样的印象？他们喜欢我吗我听起来很愚蠢吗？我穿着没有吸引力的衣服吗？

            很明显，这种不舒服的感觉必然会对人造成不利影响。一个人对自己的观念以他或她的行为方式反映，一个人的行为方式影响到他人的反应。一般来说，人们对自己的想法对他们生活的各个方面都有深远的影响。

            害羞的人，自尊心低，很可能是被动的，容易受到别人的影响。他们需要保证，他们正在做“正确的事情”。害羞的人对批评非常敏感;他们觉得它证明了自己的卑劣感。他们也觉得很高兴与这样一个声明，“你只是说，让我感觉良好。我知道这不是真的。“很明显，虽然自我意识是一种健康的品质，但过度的是有害的。

            害羞可以完全消除，还是至少减少？幸运的是，人们在建立自信心的坚定和耐心的努力下，可以克服害羞。由于羞怯与自尊不足，所以对于人们来说，接受自己的弱点和优势是很重要的。

            我们每个人都是一个独特而有价值的个人，对自己的个人感兴趣。我们越了解自己，越容易发挥自己的潜能。让我们不要害羞地阻止我们获得丰富而充实的生活的机会。
