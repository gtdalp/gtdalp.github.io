Who will stage the games?
Preparing for the Olympic Games is a huge undertaking (工程). Just like the athletes, the host city spends years getting ready for the event. Before deciding which city will host the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has to examine bids from all over the world. Bidding for the games begins about ten years in advance. Without preparing a very strong bid, a city will not win the competition to host the games. Beijing was chosen for the 2008 games from five bidders 一 Osaka, Paris, Toronto and Istanbul.
Why does it take so long to prepare?
Building the infrastructure (基础设施) costs huge amounts of money. Holding the World Cup in 2002 in Japan and South Korea, for example, meant that ten new stadiums had to be built, as well as many hotels and an improved transport system. In Beijing, after winning the bid the government began major construction projects 一 the extension of the underground, the improvement of the airport and the building of new motorways. Each host city must also build an Olympic village for the athletes. By planting trees and creating parks, the city becomes more attractive for tourists.
Why do countries want to host the Olympic Games?
Hosting the games has a major effect on the economy and brings international prestige(声望) to the country. Thousands and thousands of visitors come to the games and the host cities are permanently improved.

When I was a little girl, my brothers and I collected stamps for many years. My mother didn't use to work during the week, but she worked in the post office near our house on Saturdays, and she used to bring home all the new stamps as soon as they were issued (发行).
On the day of the World Cup football final in London in 1966, we were very excited because England were playing West Germany in the final. When we were having lunch, my mother told us to go to the post office straightaway after the match if England won, but she didn't tell us why. At 2 o'clock my mother went back to work as usual, while the rest of the family were watching the football on TV at home. Although she wasn't watching the match, she was listening to it on the radio.
England won 4:2 and so my brothers and I ran to the post office. As we burst in, my mother was standing behind the counter. She was waiting to sell us a very special limited edition with ENGLAND WINNERS on each stamp. We were over the moon.
We still have it today，and perhaps it is worth a lot of money.
