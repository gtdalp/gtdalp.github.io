二、阅读理解

As she walked round the huge department store, Edith reflected how difficult it was to choose a suitable Christmas present for her father. She wished that he was as easy to please as her mother, who was always delighted with perfume.
Besides, shopping at this time of the year was a most unpleasant experience: people trod on your toes, poked (戳) you with their elbows and almost knocked you over in their haste to get a bargain ahead of you.
Partly to have a rest, Edith paused in front of a counter where some attractive ties were on display. “They are real silk”, the assistant assured her, trying to tempt her. “Worth double the price.” But Edith knew from past experience that her choice of ties hardly ever pleased her father.
She moved on reluctantly and then quite by chance, stopped where a small crowd of men had gathered round a counter. She found some good quality pipes on sale － and the prices were very reasonable. Edith did not hesitate for long: although her father only smoked a pipe occasionally, she knew that this was a present which was bound to please him.
When she got home, with her small well-chosen present concealed in her handbag, her parents were already at the supper table. Her mother was in an especially cheerful mood, “Your father has at last decided to stop smoking.” She told her daughter.

Today Newton is a very clean place. Many years ago, however, there were millions of rats in it. They attacked the cats and dogs. Sometimes a great number of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very large in size and they harmed many people.
The Government ordered everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they didn't kill many. The Government promised to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats everyday. A Government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile. Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day.
After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the Government office. The Government officer thought that people were stealing dad rats from the pile.
