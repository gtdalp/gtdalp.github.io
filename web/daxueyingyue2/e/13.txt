If you ask Daniel Radcliffe who acted Harry Potter to pick a special moment from the last year of his life, you will find it almost impossible. “Oh, wow, that's really difficult,” he says with a smile.
“There have been so many things, so many memories that at times it's hard to recall them all,” says Daniel. “But I guess one of the best ones was the London premiere for The Philosopher's Stone. It was just amazing, one of the best nights of my life.”
“But I've had such a great time doing The Chamber of Secrets. I love doing the work. I love meeting new people and being part of the team. It's been great.”
