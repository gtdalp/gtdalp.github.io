Once Mark Twain and two friends were sitting in a restaurant. One friend had just returned from a trip to Vermont. The friend said that the air in the mountains of Vermont was very clear. In many places the echo of a voice came back five times stronger than the original voice. The second friend said that was nothing. In Colorado, where he lived, in many places the echo of a voice spoken in the morning came back in the afternoon. Mark Twain laughed. The he said:
"Listen! The echoes which you have told about are very unusual. But in a small church in Missouri, where I was born, there is an echo more unusual even than those."
"What is so strange about the echo there?" asked one of the men.
"Well, I will tell you," said Mark Twain. "The echo in that church is so unusual that if one asks in a loud voice: Good morning! How are you? The echo repeats very clearly after a moment: Very well, thank you. And how are you?"

When I was a little girl, my brothers and I collected stamps for many years. My mother didn't use to work during the week, but she worked in the post office near our house on Saturdays, and she used to bring home all the new stamps as soon as they were issued (发行).
On the day of the World Cup football final in London in 1966, we were very excited because England were playing West Germany in the final. When we were having lunch, my mother told us to go to the post office straightaway after the match if England won, but she didn't tell us why. At 2 o'clock my mother went back to work as usual, while the rest of the family were watching the football on TV at home. Although she wasn't watching the match, she was listening to it on the radio.
England won 4:2 and so my brothers and I ran to the post office. As we burst in, my mother was standing behind the counter. She was waiting to sell us a very special limited edition with ENGLAND WINNERS on each stamp. We were over the moon.
We still have it today，and perhaps it is worth a lot of money.
