Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706 in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother and father were of Puritan (清教徒的) religion. They left England and moved to the English colony of Massachusetts in order to escape persecution (迫害) for their religion. In Boston, Franklin left school when he was ten years old and worked for his father for two years. Then he went to work on his brother's newspaper.

Once James Thornhill, a famous English painter, was asked to paint some pictures on the walls of the king's palace in England.
Then workers were sent for and a big platform（台子）was made.
With the help of a worker, Thornhill started painting on the platform. They worked for a whole year and at last the pictures were ready.
Thornhill was happy when he looked at the pictures, for they were really beautiful. He looked at them for a long time, and then took one step back and looked again. Now the pictures were even more beautiful. He took another step, then another. Finally he was at the very edge of the platform, but he didn't know it because he was thinking of his pictures.
