Let me tell you a story about Bert and Mildred Bumbridge, who were very forgetful. For example, Mildred would forget to cook dinner, or Bert would go to work on Sunday, thinking it was Monday. One summer they were to take a long plane trip. What do you suppose happened? Well, they got to the airport with only ten minutes to spare. So time was short. They just had to buy some flight insurance first. After all, who knows what will happen on a plane flight? They quickly put some coins into a machine and out came their insurance policy（保险单）.
"Who would get the money if we crash, I wonder?" asked Mildred.
