On Christmas Eve 1971, Julia Smith was taking a flight in Peru with her mother to join her father, a professor, who was an expert on the jungle and plants and animals living there. Unfortunately, the plane crashed in a storm. The passengers all died except Julia who only had a few cuts. She was determined to survive. She had no map, only a bag of sweets and her torn clothes. She found a stream and followed it, trying to keep in the shade as much as possible, because she had no hat. For ten days, she walked along the river, eating fruits from the trees. At night she slept near the river bank, on the ground which was wet from the rain. She often felt weak, but she refused to give up. On the 10th day, she arrived at a small hut. The three Indian hunters who visited the hut every two weeks rescued her and took her by boat to a small village from where she was flown to a hospital. She was safe at last.

Today Newton is a very clean place. Many years ago, however, there were millions of rats in it. They attacked the cats and dogs. Sometimes a great number of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very large in size and they harmed many people.
The Government ordered everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they didn't kill many. The Government promised to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats everyday. A Government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile. Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day.
After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the Government office. The Government officer thought that people were stealing dad rats from the pile.
