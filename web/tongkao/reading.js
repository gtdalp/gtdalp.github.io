        title: 'In 1626, Manhattan Island was purchased（购买）from the Indians by Peter Minuit. It cost about $ 2,400. At first, it was called New Amsterdam by the Dutch settlers. Later it was renamed New York by the English.\n\
        The city grew rapidly. There were several reasons for this, but the most important one is its location. New York is situated on the best American harbor on the Atlantic Ocean. It also lies on the Hudson River, which allows water transportation into the middle of the United States.\n\
        Today New York has a population of approximately eight million. The city has groups from many races. It is famous for its Chinatown. It also has the largest Jewish population of any city outside Israel. After the blacks were released from slavery, a large number of them moved into cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. More recently, people from Puerto Rico have done the same thing.\n\
        New York is made up of five boroughs（行政区）. The Bronx is the only one located on the mainland, with Brooklyn, Richmond, and Queens being on islands. It is a large manufacturing center because factories can be located near good water transportation. Two of the main businesses are the clothing industry and the printing industry. Most large publishing companies have their headquarters there.',

It is thought that we won’t have to go shopping because we will be able to get most things which are sold in shops on the Internet. There will be no more books because we will be able to get all texts from computers. The Internet will be used to play games，see films and buy food. Most telephone calls will be made by computers. \
        Some people are glad about these new ways of shopping and communicating. Others do not think that computers will replace our old ways. \
        Let’s look at books，for example. Some people think that one day we will not read books made of paper. Instead，we will buy and read books using computers. We will read texts on small pocket computers. The computers will keep many different books in them at the same time. We won’t need to turn lots of pages and paper will be saved. Computerized (计算机化的) books will be used more and more. \
        Is Internet shopping such a pleasure as going to the shop? Many people say it is not. It is a pleasure to go into shops and look at things you want to buy. Also probably people won’t like to read large texts on our computers. Because paper books seem to be more friendly. Maybe computers won’t change these two habits. ',

        Another way is energy conservation（节能）, which means using energy more efficiently. In some very cold countries, people build special houses to save energy. They place materials between the inside and outside of the walls of the house to keep the cold out and the warmth in.\
        Finally, renewable energy sources are used even though they are often expensive to develop. One form of these is geothermal energy（地热）.

Shy people are anxious and self-conscious; that is, they are excessively concerned with their own appearance and actions. Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes?\
    //     It is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must negatively affect people. A person’s conception of himself or herself is reflected in the way he or she behaves, and the way a person behaves affects other people’s reactions. In general, the way people think about themselves has a profound effect on all areas of their lives.\
    //     Shy people, having low self-esteem, are likely to be passive and easily influenced by others. They need reassurance that they are doing “the right thing.” Shy people are very sensitive to criticism; they feel it confirms their feelings of inferiority. They also find it difficult to be pleased by compliment with a statement like this one, “You’re just saying that to make me feel good. I know it’s not true.” It is clear that while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful.\
    //     Can shyness be completely eliminated, or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can overcome shyness with determined and patient efforts in building self-confidence. Since shyness goes hand in hand with a lack of self-esteem, it is important for people to accept their weaknesses as well as their strengths.\
    //     Each one of us is a unique, worthwhile individual, interested in our own personal ways. The better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to live up to our full potential. Let’s not allow shyness to block our chances for a rich and fulfilling life. ',

Radio, telegraph, television, and other inventions <em class="col-red">__22__</em> competition for newspapers. So did the development of magazines and other means of communication. However, this competition merely spurred the newspapers on. They quickly made use of the newer and faster means of communication to improve the speed and thus the efficiency of their own operations. Today more newspapers are <em class="col-red">__23__</em> and read than ever before. Newspapers influence readers’ economic choices through advertising. Most newspapers depend on advertising for their very existence. Newspapers are sold at a price that <em class="col-red">__24__</em> even a small fraction of the cost of production. The main source of income for most newspapers is commercial advertising. The chance in selling advertising depends on a newspaper’s value to advertisers. This <em class="col-red">__25__</em> in terms of circulation. How many people read the newspaper? Circulation depends somewhat on the work of the circulation department and on the services or entertainment offered in a newspaper’s pages. But for the most part, circulation depends on a newspaper’s value to readers as a source of information.',
